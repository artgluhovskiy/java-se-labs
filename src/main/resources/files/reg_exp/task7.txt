In computing, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, also known as dynamic translation, is compilation done during execution
of a program – at run time – rather than prior to execution.[1] Most often this consists of translation to machine code,
which is then executed directly, but can also refer to translation to another format. A system implementing a JIT
compiler typically continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup
gained from compilation would outweigh the overhead of compiling that code.
